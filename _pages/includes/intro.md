<!-- **I am expected to graduate in June 2024 and I'm on the job market (acadamia/industry). Consider dropping me an email if you have any suitable opportunities.** -->


<!-- My research interest covers a wide range, including Sensor and CPS Security, Audio Security, AI Security, as well as Speech Signal Processing. If you are seeking any form of <b>academic cooperation</b>, please feel free to email me at lxfmakeit(at)zju(dot)edu(dot)cn. -->
My research is broadly in the field of AI and IoT security, with a particular interest in safeguarding user privacy, intelligent audio/vision systems, and generative models against various forms of leaks and attacks.
I work toward developing dependable and secure machine learning (ML) systems and am committed to making their applications for deployment in critical infrastructures and consumer electronics. In user-oriented contexts, my investigations also encompass the interplay between protecting user privacy and enhancing the usability of machine learning systems. In model-oriented scenarios, such as the use of generative models in model-as-a-service (MaaS) applications, my work involves regulating their behavior to align with societal responsibilities.

I have published 10+ papers at the top-tier international security/AI/mobile sensing conferences and journals, such as USENIX Security, ACM CCS, NDSS, TDSC, IoT-J, and ACM MM.
