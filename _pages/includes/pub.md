[Raconteur : A Knowledgeable, Insightful, and Portable LLM-Powered Shell Command Explainer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02074) Jiangyi Deng<sup>*</sup>, **Xinfeng Li<sup>*</sup>**, Yanjiao Chen, Yijie Bai, Haiqin Weng, Yan Liu, Tao Wei, Wenyuan Xu. In Proceedings of Network and Distributed System Security Symposium, **NDSS 2025** (CCF-A, Big4) [[Website](https://raconteur-ndss.github.io/)]

Raconteur is the first tool using Large Language Models (LLMs) to explain shell commands clearly. It provides detailed insights into command functions and purposes, aligning with MITRE ATT&CK standards. Equipped with professional cybersecurity knowledge, Raconteur delivers accurate explanations. A documentation retriever helps understand new commands. Tested extensively, Raconteur offers unique insights, helping security analysts better understand command intentions.

[SafeGen: Mitigating Sexually Explicit Content Generation in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06666) **Xinfeng Li**, Yuchen Yang, Jiangyi Deng, Chen Yan, Yanjiao Chen, Xiaoyu Ji, Wenyuan Xu. To appear in Proceedings of ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, **CCS 2024** (CCF-A, Big4) [[Code](https://github.com/LetterLiGo/SafeGen_CCS2024)][[Pretrained Weights](https://huggingface.co/LetterJohn/SafeGen-Pretrained-Weights)]

As T2I technologies advance, their misuse to generate sexually explicit content has become a major concern. SafeGen effectively mitigates this by removing any explicit visual representations from the model, making it safe regardless of the adversarial text input, outperforming eight other protection approaches. SafeGen adjusts the model's visual self-attention layers to ensure that the high-quality production of benign images is not compromised.

[SafeEar: Content Privacy-Preserving Audio Deepfake Detection](https://letterligo.github.io/SafeEar/) **Xinfeng Li**, Kai Li, Yifan Zheng, Chen Yan, Xiaoyu Ji, Wenyuan Xu. To appear in Proceedings of ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, **CCS 2024** (CCF-A, Big4) [[Project Page](https://letterligo.github.io/SafeEar/)]

To our knowledge, SafeEar is the first content privacy-preserving audio deepfake detection framework. Since audio deepfakes and user privacy concerns have been increasingly significant societal issues, we demonstrate how to achieve reliable deepfake detection while preventing both machine and human adversaries from eavesdropping on sensitive user speech content. To facilitate future research, we also develop a comprehensive multilingual deepfake datasets (more than 1,500,000 genuine & deepfake audio samples) using advanced TTS/VC techniques.
